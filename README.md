# Fish_classification

This project works on decision tree classification to classsify the fish species based on parameters given such ha weight,width,height,length1,length2,length3.


## Getting started

Example for fish-classification deployed to Heroku
https://fish-classification-python.herokuapp.com/

What Is This?
-------------

This is a simple Python/Flask application intended to provide a working example of classification external web UI . The goal of these endpoints is to be simple, well-documented and to provide a base for developers to develop other applications off of.


How To Use This
---------------

1. Download the python file and csv file to test
2. Download the flask file in visual studio or spyder 
3. Run the code in any of the above IDE and paste the url received on browser eg:n http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
4. Down load the Html and css file and run same as above
5. Create account on Heroku https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
6. Link the github path to Heroku account after creating new app on Heroku cloud.
7. Select manual deploy on the Heroku cloud.
8. After successful deploy https://fish-classification-python.herokuapp.com/ run the link created on browser
9. If error are generated check the requirement.txt file and update with necessary version of system .


Testing
-------

1. Install the dependencies
2. Run the url generated on brower
3. Enter the requried parameters to find which species that fish belong


Development
-----------
